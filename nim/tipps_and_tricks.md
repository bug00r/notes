# Tipps and Tricks 

Sometimes we want todo more hacky or nice things to have, not thinking about how other developer will think about.

For myself i want wo examine following things:

- [ ] Adding blobs into binary(may not the wrapped c way)
- [ ] Adding sqlite to my Application
- [ ] Organizing resources (currently using a zip blob :D)
- [ ] Fancy crossplatform ui available(first test with cimgui)
- [ ] C based ui used with nim based app engine
