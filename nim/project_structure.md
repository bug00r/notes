# Project Structure

At my first look around about usable project structure in nim projects and modules. I cam across a toll called Nimble.
I will use it and later, if i got some experience i will write a summary about my own thoughts about it.

At first i started reading the [Nimble doc about project structures](https://nim-lang.github.io/nimble/create-packages.html#project-structure).

During my developement experience there are popping up every time the same questions:

* If we are able to use dependecies, where are they saved?
* I am able configure where this nim modules will be saved?
* Github or any other repo using is fine, but what about local repositories?
* How to organise or configure local repo's?
* What about unittests? (yes, i like making tests)
* Some process may be grown in complexity, can we make is more easy?

# Summary

TODO: How does the work with Nimble fells like?
